Build up a Linear Regression model by coding. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression

the data is a 100 sets of two values; (call x and y)

Step 1; 
Use training data to build up the linear regression

Step 2; 
Use test data's x to try to guess y

Step 3; 
Compare with the test data's y, and calculate RMS value. 

Step 4; (Optional) 
If you can make better model than Linear Regression, 
please do coding & calculate better RMS.
